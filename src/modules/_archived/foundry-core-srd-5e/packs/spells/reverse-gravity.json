All creatures and objects in that area that aren't anchored to the ground fall upward and reach the top of the Cylinder [Area of Effect]|XPHB|Cylinder. A creature can make a Dexterity saving throw to grab a fixed object it can reach, thus avoiding the fall upward. If a ceiling or an anchored object is encountered in this upward fall, creatures and objects strike it just as they would during a downward fall. If an affected creature or object reaches the Cylinder [Area of Effect]|XPHB|Cylinder's top without striking anything, it hovers there for the duration. When the spell ends, affected objects and creatures fall downward.",
