While holding the staff, you can use any of its properties: • You can expend 1 of the staff's charges to cast Charm Person|XPHB, Command|XPHB, or Comprehend Languages|XPHB from it using your spell save DC.\n• If you succeed on a saving throw against an Enchantment spell that targets only you, you can take a Reaction|XPHB to expend 1 charge from the staff and turn the spell back on its caster as if you had cast the spell.\n• If you fail a saving throw against an Enchantment spell that targets only you, you can turn your failed save into a successful one. You can't use this property of the staff again until the next dawn.\nThe staff regains 1d8 + 2 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll 1d20. On a 1, the staff crumbles to dust and is destroyed.\n\n<p><strong>Attunement:</strong> by a bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, warlock, or wizard</p>",
