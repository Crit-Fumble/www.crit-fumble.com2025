It manifests in an unoccupied space you can see within range and uses the Giant Insect|XPHB stat block. The form you choose determines certain details in its stat block. The creature disappears when it drops to 0 Hit Points|XPHB or when the spell ends. The creature is an ally to you and your allies. In combat, the creature shares your Initiative|XPHB count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don't issue any, it takes the Dodge|XPHB action and uses its movement to avoid danger.\n\n<p><strong>At Higher Levels:</strong> Use the spell slot's level for the spell's level in the stat block.</p>",
