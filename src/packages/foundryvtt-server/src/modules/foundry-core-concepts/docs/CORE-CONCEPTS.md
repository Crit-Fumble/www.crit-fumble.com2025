A Tabletop Role-Playing Game Can be broken down into some basic concepts

- sheets (in most games, for tracking resources, keeping score, and storing info from "cards", "books", and other sources)
- attributes (things to track, such as name or experience points)
- types (things like class, creature type, or other complex items; may be filled by a "card")
- dice (in most games)
- tables (in most games)
- books (contain rules, cards, tables, systems, modes, and other data)
- cards (things like permanant stat blocks for NPCs, Spell, and Item Descriptions; can define a "type" and "properties")
- hand (a subset of cards)
- deck (a set of cards)
- boards (maps, the battlegrid if a grid exists, represents the play area, can hold several location "sheets", with "wilderness" or "path" tiles between them; gridless boards are measured in voxels instead of pixels; pixels represent units going down to 0.1 of an inch at the lowest scale; can be 2d or 3d)
- tiles (a single space on the board, usually square, hex, block, or voxel; a "tile" depends on the scale and dimensions of the board/map)
- rules (usually at least one)
- events (usually several, knight takes rook)
- goals (take the opponent's king, save the princess, etc)
- sessions (entire game or portion of full game)


complex core concepts
---------------------
- modes (Character Creation, Combat, Exploration, Social Interaction, Travel, Downtime, etc; uses rules and systems of rules to allow players to interact with locations, objects, other creatures, and "systems")
- systems (usually at least one; such as d20 test or damage roll, but may also be things like weather and travel pace; assembles rules into systems used by modes; magic is a system, rage is a system, character progression is a system, etc)
- creatures (including player characters)
- locations (at least one, can be as small as a single pixel/voxel)
- objects (usually at least one)
