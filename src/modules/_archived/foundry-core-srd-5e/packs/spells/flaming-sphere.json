It lasts for the duration. Any creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of the sphere makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d6 Fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. As a Bonus Action|XPHB, you can move the sphere up to 30 feet, rolling it along the ground. If you move the sphere into a creature's space, that creature makes the save against the sphere, and the sphere stops moving for the turn. When you move the sphere, you can direct it over barriers up to 5 feet tall and jump it across pits up to 10 feet wide. Flammable objects that aren't being worn or carried start burning|XPHB if touched by the sphere, and it sheds Bright Light|XPHB in a 20-foot radius and Dim Light|XPHB for an additional 20 feet.\n\n<p><strong>At Higher Levels:</strong> The damage increases by 2d6|2-9|1d6 for each spell slot level above 2.</p>",
