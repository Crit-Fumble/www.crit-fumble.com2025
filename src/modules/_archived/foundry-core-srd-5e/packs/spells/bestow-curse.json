Until the curse ends, the target suffers one of the following effects of your choice: • Choose one ability. The target has Disadvantage|XPHB on ability checks and saving throws made with that ability.\n• The target has Disadvantage|XPHB on attack rolls against you.\n• In combat, the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw at the start of each of its turns or be forced to take the Dodge|XPHB action on that turn.\n• If you deal damage to the target with an attack roll or a spell, the target takes an extra 1d8 Necrotic damage.\n\n<p><strong>At Higher Levels:</strong> If you cast this spell using a level 4 spell slot, you can maintain Concentration|XPHB on it for up to 10 minutes. If you use a level 5+ spell slot, the spell doesn't require Concentration|XPHB, and the duration becomes 8 hours (level 5-6 slot) or 24 hours (level 7-8 slot). If you use a level 9 spell slot, the spell lasts until dispelled.</p>",
