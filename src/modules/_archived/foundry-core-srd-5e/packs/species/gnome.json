Choose one of the following options; whichever one you choose, Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for the spells you cast with this trait (choose the ability when you select the lineage): • You know the Minor Illusion|XPHB cantrip. You also always have the Speak with Animals|XPHB spell prepared. You can cast it without a spell slot a number of times equal to your Proficiency|XPHB|Proficiency Bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest|XPHB. You can also use any spell slots you have to cast the spell.\n• You know the Mending|XPHB and Prestidigitation|XPHB cantrips. In addition, you can spend 10 minutes casting Prestidigitation|XPHB to create a Tiny clockwork device (AC 5, 1 HP), such as a toy, fire starter, or music box. When you create the device, you determine its function by choosing one effect from Prestidigitation|XPHB; the device produces that effect whenever you or another creature takes a Bonus Action|XPHB to activate it with a touch. If the chosen effect has options within it, you choose one of those options for the device when you create it. For example, if you choose the spell's ignite-extinguish effect, you determine whether the device ignites or extinguishes fire; the device doesn't do both. You can have three such devices in existence at a time, and each falls apart 8 hours after its creation or when you dismantle it with a touch as a Utilize|XPHB action.",
