While the blade exists, this magic weapon functions as a Longsword with {@itemProperty F|XPHB|Finesse}. If you are proficient with Longswords or Shortswords, you are proficient with the Sun Blade. You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with this weapon, which deals Radiant damage instead of Slashing damage. When you hit an Undead with it, that target takes an extra 1d8 Radiant damage.The sword's luminous blade emits Bright Light|XPHB in a 15-foot radius and Dim Light|XPHB for an additional 15 feet. The light is sunlight. While the blade persists, you can take a Magic|XPHB action to expand or reduce its radius of Bright Light|XPHB and Dim Light|XPHB by 5 feet each, to a maximum of 30 feet each or a minimum of 10 feet each.\n\n<p><strong>Attunement:</strong> true</p>",
