      "value": "<p><strong>Level 6</strong> Evocation</p>\n<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>\n<p><strong>Range:</strong> 120 feet</p>\n<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a piece of quartz)</p>\n<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p>\n\nYou create a wall of ice on a solid surface within range. You can form it into a hemispherical dome or a globe with a radius of up to 10 feet, or you can shape a flat surface made up of ten 10-foot-square panels. Each panel must be contiguous with another panel. In any form, the wall is 1 foot thick and lasts for the duration. If the wall cuts through a creature's space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (you choose which side) and makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 10d6 Cold damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. The wall is an object that can be damaged and thus breached. It has AC 12 and 30 Hit Points|XPHB per 10-foot section, and it has Immunity|XPHB to Cold, Poison, and Psychic damage and Vulnerability|XPHB to Fire damage. Reducing a 10-foot section of wall to 0 Hit Points|XPHB destroys it and leaves behind a sheet of frigid air in the space the wall occupied. A creature moving through the sheet of frigid air for the first time on a turn makes a Constitution saving throw, taking 5d6 Cold damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.\n\n<p><strong>At Higher Levels:</strong> The damage the wall deals when it appears increases by 10d6|6-9|2d6 and the damage from passing through the sheet of frigid air increases by 5d6|6-9|1d6 for each spell slot level above 6.</p>",
