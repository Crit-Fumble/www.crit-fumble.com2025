The broom stops hovering when you land or when you're no longer riding it. As a Magic|XPHB action, you can send the broom to travel alone to a destination within 1 mile of you if you name the location and are familiar with it. The broom comes back to you when you take a Magic|XPHB action and use a command word if the broom is still within 1 mile of you.\n\n<p><strong>Attunement:</strong> true</p>",
