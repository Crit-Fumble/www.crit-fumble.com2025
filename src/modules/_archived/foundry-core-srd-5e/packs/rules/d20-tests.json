These rolls are called D20 Tests, and they come in three kinds: ability checks, saving throws, and attack rolls.</p>\n\n<h3>D20 Test Steps</h3>\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>Roll 1d20.</strong> You always want to roll high. If the roll has Advantage or Disadvantage, you roll two d20s, but you use the number from only one of them—the higher one if you have Advantage or the lower one if you have Disadvantage.</li>\n  <li><strong>Add Modifiers.</strong> Add these modifiers to the number rolled on the d20:\n    <ul>\n      <li><strong>The Relevant Ability Modifier.</strong></li>\n      <li><strong>Your Proficiency Bonus If Relevant.</strong></li>\n      <li><strong>Circumstantial Bonuses and Penalties.</strong> A class feature, a spell, or another rule might give a bonus or penalty.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li><strong>Compare the Total to a Target Number.</strong> If the total equals or exceeds the target number, the D20 Test succeeds. Otherwise, it fails. The target number for an ability check or saving throw is called a Difficulty Class (DC). The target number for an attack roll is called an Armor Class (AC).</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>Ability Checks</h3>\n<p>An ability check represents a creature using talent and training to try to overcome a challenge. The GM calls for an ability check when a creature attempts something other than an attack that has a chance of meaningful failure.</p>\n\n<h4>Ability Check Examples</h4>\n<table>\n  <tr><th>Ability</th><th>Make a Check To…</th></tr>\n  <tr><td>Strength</td><td>Lift, push, pull, or break something</td></tr>\n  <tr><td>Dexterity</td><td>Move nimbly, quickly, or quietly</td></tr>\n  <tr><td>Constitution</td><td>Push your body beyond normal limits</td></tr>\n  <tr><td>Intelligence</td><td>Reason or remember</td></tr>\n  <tr><td>Wisdom</td><td>Notice things in the environment or in creatures' behavior</td></tr>\n  <tr><td>Charisma</td><td>Influence, entertain, or deceive</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n<h4>Difficulty Class</h4>\n<p>The Difficulty Class represents the task's difficulty. The more difficult the task, the higher its DC.</p>\n\n<table>\n  <tr><th>Task Difficulty</th><th>DC</th></tr>\n  <tr><td>Very easy</td><td>5</td></tr>\n  <tr><td>Easy</td><td>10</td></tr>\n  <tr><td>Medium</td><td>15</td></tr>\n  <tr><td>Hard</td><td>20</td></tr>\n  <tr><td>Very hard</td><td>25</td></tr>\n  <tr><td>Nearly impossible</td><td>30</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n<h3>Saving Throws</h3>\n<p>A saving throw—also called a save—represents an attempt to evade or resist a threat. You don't normally choose to make a save; you must make one because your character or a monster is at risk.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you don't want to resist the effect, you can choose to fail the save without rolling.</p>\n\n<h4>Saving Throw Examples</h4>\n<table>\n  <tr><th>Ability</th><th>Make a Save To…</th></tr>\n  <tr><td>Strength</td><td>Physically resist direct force</td></tr>\n  <tr><td>Dexterity</td><td>Dodge out of harm's way</td></tr>\n  <tr><td>Constitution</td><td>Endure a toxic hazard</td></tr>\n  <tr><td>Intelligence</td><td>Recognize an illusion as fake</td></tr>\n  <tr><td>Wisdom</td><td>Resist a mental assault</td></tr>\n  <tr><td>Charisma</td><td>Assert your identity</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n<h3>Attack Rolls</h3>\n<p>An attack roll determines whether an attack hits a target. An attack roll hits if the roll equals or exceeds the target's Armor Class.</p>\n\n<h4>Attack Roll Abilities</h4>\n<table>\n  <tr><th>Ability</th><th>Attack Type</th></tr>\n  <tr><td>Strength</td><td>Melee attack with a weapon or an Unarmed Strike</td></tr>\n  <tr><td>Dexterity</td><td>Ranged attack with a weapon</td></tr>\n  <tr><td>Varies</td><td>Spell attack (the ability used is determined by the spellcaster's spellcasting feature)</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n<h4>Proficiency Bonus</h4>\n<p>Add your Proficiency Bonus to attack rolls you make with weapons you're proficient with and to spell attack rolls.</p>\n\n<h4>Armor Class</h4>\n<p>The target's Armor Class is the number an attack roll must equal or exceed to hit. AC represents how well a creature avoids being wounded in combat.</p>"
