The spirit lasts for the duration, and it looks like a Fey creature of your choice. When the spirit appears, you can make one melee spell attack against a creature within 5 feet of it. On a hit, the target takes Psychic damage equal to 3d12 plus your spellcasting ability modifier, and the target has the Frightened|XPHB condition until the start of your next turn, with both you and the spirit as the source of the fear. As a Bonus Action|XPHB on your later turns, you can teleport the spirit to an unoccupied space you can see within 30 feet of the space it left and make the attack against a creature within 5 feet of it.\n\n<p><strong>At Higher Levels:</strong> The damage increases by 3d12|6-9|1d12 for each spell slot level above 6.</p>",
