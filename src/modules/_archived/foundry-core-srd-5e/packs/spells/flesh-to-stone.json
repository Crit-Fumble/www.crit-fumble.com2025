The target makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it has the Restrained|XPHB condition for the duration. On a successful save, its Speed|XPHB is 0 until the start of your next turn. Constructs automatically succeed on the save. A Restrained|XPHB target makes another Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves against this spell three times, the spell ends. If it fails its saves three times, it is turned to stone and has the Petrified|XPHB condition for the duration. The successes and failures needn't be consecutive; keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind. If you maintain your Concentration|XPHB on this spell for the entire possible duration, the target is Petrified|XPHB until the condition is ended by Greater Restoration|XPHB or similar magic.",
