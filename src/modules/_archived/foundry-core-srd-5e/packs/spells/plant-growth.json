All normal plants in a 100-foot-radius Sphere [Area of Effect]|XPHB|Sphere centered on that point become thick and overgrown. A creature moving through that area must spend 4 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves. You can exclude one or more areas of any size within the spell's area from being affected.All plants in a half-mile radius centered on a point within range become enriched for 365 days.
