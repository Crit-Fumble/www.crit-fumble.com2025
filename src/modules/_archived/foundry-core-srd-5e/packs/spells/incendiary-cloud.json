The cloud's area is Heavily Obscured|XPHB. It lasts for the duration or until a strong wind (like that created by Gust of Wind|XPHB) disperses it. When the cloud appears, each creature in it makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 10d8 Fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature must also make this save when the Sphere [Area of Effect]|XPHB|Sphere moves into its space and when it enters the Sphere [Area of Effect]|XPHB|Sphere or ends its turn there. A creature makes this save only once per turn. The cloud moves 10 feet away from you in a direction you choose at the start of each of your turns.",
