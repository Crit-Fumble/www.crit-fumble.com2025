Spaces within Universes
-----------------------

Each VTT server will host it's own "Space", or rather, a 100x100x100 voxel space which contains each scale explained in www.crit-fumble.com\docs\VTTImageScaleGuidelines.md. A "Universe" is composed of several servers, and a "Multiverse" encloses all game Universes.


Creating a World Free Options

Option A: Inside Out: Create a Starting Location on an Open World 
------------------------------------------------
The GM creates a single starting location for their players to adventure in on an existing world which is not currently in use, then chooses an open space for it in an existing world. The GM and players then add to the world around the location through gameplay as the group adventures. They can place nearby Bodies of Water, Wilderness Terrains/Environments, Buildings, Settlements, Counties, Kingdoms, Continents, and Realms as desired before the game begins, as they play, or between sessions.

Location -> Settlement/Wilderness -> County -> Province -> Kingdom -> Continent/Ocean -> Realm -> World -> Orbital Space -> Sector -> World Space

Option B: Outside-In: Create a new World in an open Sector (FoundryVTT server)
-----------------------------------------------
The GM selects or creates a Sector, Space (place or select Plane/Planet to create new orbital space), and Planet/Plane/Planetoid (place within existing orbital space to place a "moon", or use world placed when creating "orbital" space) to create their World on.

World Space -> Sector -> Orbital Space -> World -> Realm -> Continent/Ocean -> Kingdom -> Province -> County -> Settlement/Wilderness -> Location

Once the world is set up, GMs will create at least 1 Realm, which contains at least 1 Ocean or 1 Continent to start. They can then place more oceans or continents. When finished, they will create at least one "Realm".

A "Realm" can contain many "Kingdoms", as well as portions of the surrounding "Wilderness" and bodies of water (Oceans, Seas, Large Lakes, etc)

The GM then selects a "Realm" to place at least 1 "Kingdom" or "Wilderness" in. If they place Wilderness (open sea on an ocean), then they proceed to place a location Otherwise, they create as many layers as they wish through "Province", "County, "Settlement", and "Building".

From here, they proceed to create an adventure location as in Option A
