Choose the spirit's element, which determines its damage type: air (Lightning), earth (Thunder), fire (Fire), or water (Cold). The spirit lasts for the duration. Whenever a creature you can see enters the spirit's space or starts its turn within 5 feet of the spirit, you can force that creature to make a Dexterity saving throw if the spirit has no creature Restrained|XPHB. On failed save, the target takes 8d8 damage of the spirit's type, and the target has the Restrained|XPHB condition until the spell ends. At the start of each of its turns, the Restrained|XPHB target repeats the save. On a failed save, the target takes 4d8 damage of the spirit's type. On a successful save, the target isn't Restrained|XPHB by the spirit.\n\n<p><strong>At Higher Levels:</strong> The damage increases by 8d8;4d8|5-9|1d8 for each spell slot level above 5.</p>",
