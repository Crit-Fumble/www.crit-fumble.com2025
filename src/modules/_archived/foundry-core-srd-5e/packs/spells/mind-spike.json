On a failed save, you also always know the target's location until the spell ends, but only while the two of you are on the same plane of existence. While you have this knowledge, the target can't become hidden from you, and if it has the Invisible|XPHB condition, it gains no benefit from that condition against you.\n\n<p><strong>At Higher Levels:</strong> The damage increases by 3d8|2-9|1d8 for each spell slot level above 2.</p>",
