As a Utilize|XPHB action, you can sprinkle a pinch of the dust over water, turning up to a 15-foot Cube [Area of Effect]|XPHB|Cube of water into one marble-sized pellet, which floats or rests near where the dust was sprinkled. The pellet's weight is negligible. A creature can take a Utilize|XPHB action to smash the pellet against a hard surface, causing the pellet to shatter and release the water the dust absorbed. Doing so destroys the pellet and ends its magic. As a Utilize|XPHB action, you can sprinkle a pinch of the dust on an Elemental within 5 feet of yourself that is composed mostly of water (such as a Water Elemental|XMM or a Water Weird|XMM). Such a creature exposed to a pinch of the dust makes a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 10d6 Necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.",
