You can affect and be affected only by other creatures on the Ethereal Plane, and creatures on the other plane can't perceive you unless they have a special ability that lets them perceive things on the Ethereal Plane. You return to the other plane at the start of your next turn and when the spell ends if you are on the Ethereal Plane.
