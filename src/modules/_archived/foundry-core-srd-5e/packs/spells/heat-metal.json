You cause the object to glow red-hot. Any creature in physical contact with the object takes 2d8 Fire damage when you cast the spell. Until the spell ends, you can take a Bonus Action|XPHB on each of your later turns to deal this damage again if the object is within range. If a creature is holding or wearing the object and takes the damage from it, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or drop the object if it can. If it doesn't drop the object, it has Disadvantage|XPHB on attack rolls and ability checks until the start of your next turn.\n\n<p><strong>At Higher Levels:</strong> The damage increases by 2d8|2-9|1d8 for each spell slot level above 2.</p>",
