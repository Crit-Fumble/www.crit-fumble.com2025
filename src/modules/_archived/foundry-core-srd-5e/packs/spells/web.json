The webs fill a 20-foot Cube [Area of Effect]|XPHB|Cube there for the duration. The webs are Difficult Terrain|XPHB, and the area within them is Lightly Obscured|XPHB. If the webs aren't anchored between two solid masses (such as walls or trees) or layered across a floor, wall, or ceiling, the web collapses on itself, and the spell ends at the start of your next turn. Webs layered over a flat surface have a depth of 5 feet. The first time a creature enters the webs on a turn or starts its turn there, it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or have the Restrained|XPHB condition while in the webs or until it breaks free. A creature Restrained|XPHB by the webs can take an action to make a Strength (Athletics|XPHB) check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it is no longer Restrained|XPHB. The webs are flammable. Any 5-foot Cube [Area of Effect]|XPHB|Cube of webs exposed to fire burns away in 1 round, dealing 2d4 Fire damage to any creature that starts its turn in the fire.",
