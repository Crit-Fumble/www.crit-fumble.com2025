It takes the shape of a Cylinder [Area of Effect]|XPHB|Cylinder that is 10 feet tall with a 60-foot radius. When you cast the spell, choose a point you can see under the cloud. A lightning bolt shoots from the cloud to that point. Each creature within 5 feet of that point makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d10 Lightning damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. Until the spell ends, you can take a Magic|XPHB action to call down lightning in that way again, targeting the same point or a different one. If you're outdoors in a storm when you cast this spell, the spell gives you control over that storm instead of creating a new one. Under such conditions, the spell's damage increases by 1d10.\n\n<p><strong>At Higher Levels:</strong> The damage increases by 3d10|3-9|1d10 for each spell slot level above 3.</p>",
