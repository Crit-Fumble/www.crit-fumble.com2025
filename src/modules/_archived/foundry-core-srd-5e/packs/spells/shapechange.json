The new form must be of a creature that has a Challenge Rating|XPHB no higher than your level or Challenge Rating|XPHB. You must have seen the sort of creature before, and it can't be a Construct or an Undead. When you cast the spell, you gain a number of Temporary Hit Points|XPHB equal to the Hit Points|XPHB of the first form into which you shape-shift. These Temporary Hit Points|XPHB vanish if any remain when the spell ends. Your game statistics are replaced by the stat block of the chosen form, but you retain your creature type; alignment; personality; Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores; Hit Points|XPHB; Hit Point Dice|XPHB; proficiencies; and ability to communicate. If you have the Spellcasting feature, you retain it too. Upon shape-shifting, you determine whether your equipment drops to the ground or changes in size and shape to fit the new form while you're in it.",
