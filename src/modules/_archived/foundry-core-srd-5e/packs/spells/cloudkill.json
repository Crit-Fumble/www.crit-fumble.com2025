The fog lasts for the duration or until strong wind (such as the one created by Gust of Wind|XPHB) disperses it, ending the spell. Its area is Heavily Obscured|XPHB. Each creature in the Sphere [Area of Effect]|XPHB|Sphere makes a Constitution saving throw, taking 5d8 Poison damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature must also make this save when the Sphere [Area of Effect]|XPHB|Sphere moves into its space and when it enters the Sphere [Area of Effect]|XPHB|Sphere or ends its turn there. A creature makes this save only once per turn. The Sphere [Area of Effect]|XPHB|Sphere moves 10 feet away from you at the start of each of your turns.\n\n<p><strong>At Higher Levels:</strong> The damage increases by 5d8|5-9|1d8 for each spell slot level above 5.</p>",
