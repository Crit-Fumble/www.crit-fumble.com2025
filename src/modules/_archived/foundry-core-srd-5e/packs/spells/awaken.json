The target must be either a Beast|bestiary|type=beast|intelligence=[0;3]|miscellaneous=!swarm or Plant|bestiary|type=plant|intelligence=[0;3]|miscellaneous=!swarm creature with an Intelligence of 3 or less or a natural plant that isn't a creature. The target gains an Intelligence of 10 and the ability to speak one language you know. If the target is a natural plant, it becomes a Plant creature and gains the ability to move its limbs, roots, vines, creepers, and so forth, and it gains senses similar to a human's. The DM chooses statistics appropriate for the awakened Plant, such as the statistics for the Awakened Shrub|XMM or Awakened Tree|XMM in the Monster Manual|XMM. The awakened target has the Charmed|XPHB condition for 30 days or until you or your allies deal damage to it. When that condition ends, the awakened creature chooses its attitude toward you.",
