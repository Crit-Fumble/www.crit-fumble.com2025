Until the spell ends, Dim Light|XPHB fills the Cylinder [Area of Effect]|XPHB|Cylinder, and you can take a Magic|XPHB action on later turns to move the Cylinder [Area of Effect]|XPHB|Cylinder up to 60 feet. When the Cylinder [Area of Effect]|XPHB|Cylinder appears, each creature in it makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d10 Radiant damage, and if the creature is shape-shifted (as a result of the Polymorph|XPHB spell, for example), it reverts to its true form and can't shape-shift until it leaves the Cylinder [Area of Effect]|XPHB|Cylinder. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only. A creature also makes this save when the spell's area moves into its space and when it enters the spell's area or ends its turn there. A creature makes this save only once per turn.\n\n<p><strong>At Higher Levels:</strong> The damage increases by 2d10|2-9|1d10 for each spell slot level above 2.</p>",
