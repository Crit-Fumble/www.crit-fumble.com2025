"Orbital Space"
---------------
Most game worlds exist within an "Orbital Space" including a Main World / Planet, other smaller bodies (moons, stellites, etc), as well as alternate planes, dimensions, and timelines. Everything in an Orbital Space can be captured in a VTT, and should follow the same game system rules; "CritOrbitalSpace" table










"Universe"
----------
A Universe is composed of many "orbital spaces". Not all systems need use the same game system, but they should all use the same or related genres. "CritUniverse" table

"Multiverse"
-----------
The total of all universes, containing all orbital spaces. Usually contains a "Core" universe which is not usually impacted directly by gameplay, and is a story-only concept that isn't intended to be used as a setting in a TTRPG. All derivative game universes are numbered incrimentally with a dash and roman numerals, like "-XIV" or "-III".  "CritMultiverse" table
