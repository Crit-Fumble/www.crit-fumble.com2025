For each creature you can see in the Cylinder [Area of Effect]|XPHB|Cylinder, choose which of these lights shines on it: • The target regains Hit Points|XPHB equal to 4d12 plus your spellcasting ability modifier.\n• The target makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 6d12 Radiant damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.\nUntil the spell ends, Bright Light|XPHB fills the Cylinder [Area of Effect]|XPHB|Cylinder, and when you move on your turn, you can also move the Cylinder [Area of Effect]|XPHB|Cylinder up to 30 feet. Whenever the Cylinder [Area of Effect]|XPHB|Cylinder moves into the space of a creature you can see and whenever a creature you can see enters the Cylinder [Area of Effect]|XPHB|Cylinder or ends its turn there, you can bathe it in one of the lights. A creature can be affected by this spell only once per turn.\n\n<p><strong>At Higher Levels:</strong> The healing and damage increase by 6d12|7-9|1d12 for each spell slot level above 7.</p>",
