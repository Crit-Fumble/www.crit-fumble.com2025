Then specify a kind of creature, such as red dragons, goblins, or vampires. A creature of the chosen kind makes a Wisdom saving throw when it comes within 120 feet of the target. Your choice of antipathy or sympathy determines what happens to a creature when it fails that save: • The creature has the Frightened|XPHB condition. The Frightened|XPHB creature must use its movement on its turns to get as far away as possible from the target, moving by the safest route.\n• The creature has the Charmed|XPHB condition. The Charmed|XPHB creature must use its movement on its turns to get as close as possible to the target, moving by the safest route. If the creature is within 5 feet of the target, the creature can't willingly move away. If the target damages the Charmed|XPHB creature, that creature can make a Wisdom saving throw to end the effect, as described below.\nIf the Frightened|XPHB or Charmed|XPHB creature ends its turn more than 120 feet away from the target, the creature makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the creature is no longer affected by the target. A creature that successfully saves against this effect is immune to it for 1 minute, after which it can be affected again.",
