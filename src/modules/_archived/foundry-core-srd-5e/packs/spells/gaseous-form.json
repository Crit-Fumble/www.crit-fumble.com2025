The spell ends on the target if it drops to 0 Hit Points|XPHB or if it takes a Magic|XPHB action to end the spell on itself. While in this form, the target's only method of movement is a Fly Speed|XPHB of 10 feet, and it can hover. The target can enter and occupy the space of another creature. The target has Resistance|XPHB to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage; it has Immunity|XPHB to the Prone|XPHB condition; and it has Advantage|XPHB on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws. The target can pass through narrow openings, but it treats liquids as though they were solid surfaces. The target can't talk or manipulate objects, and any objects it was carrying or holding can't be dropped, used, or otherwise interacted with. Finally, the target can't attack or cast spells.\n\n<p><strong>At Higher Levels:</strong> You can target one additional creature for each spell slot level above 3.</p>",
