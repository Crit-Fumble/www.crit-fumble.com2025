Whenever the Emanation [Area of Effect]|XPHB|Emanation enters the space of a creature you can see and whenever a creature you can see enters the Emanation [Area of Effect]|XPHB|Emanation or ends its turn there, you can force that creature to make a Wisdom saving throw. The creature takes 5d8 Force damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature makes this save only once per turn. In addition, you can take the Disengage|XPHB action as a Bonus Action|XPHB for the spell's duration.\n\n<p><strong>At Higher Levels:</strong> The damage increases by 5d8|4-9|1d8 for each spell slot level above 4.</p>",
