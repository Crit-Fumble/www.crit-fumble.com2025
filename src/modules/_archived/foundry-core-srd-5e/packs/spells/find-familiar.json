Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the familiar has the statistics of the chosen form, though it is a Celestial, Fey, or Fiend (your choice) instead of a Beast. Your familiar acts independently of you, but it obeys your commands. While your familiar is within 100 feet of you, you can communicate with it telepathically. Additionally, as a Bonus Action|XPHB, you can see through the familiar's eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses it has. Finally, when you cast a spell with a range of touch, your familiar can deliver the touch. Your familiar must be within 100 feet of you, and it must take a Reaction|XPHB to deliver the touch when you cast the spell.The familiar is an ally to you and your allies. It rolls its own Initiative|XPHB and acts on its own turn. A familiar can't attack, but it can take other actions as normal.When the familiar drops to 0 Hit Points|XPHB, it disappears. It reappears after you cast this spell again. As a Magic|XPHB action, you can temporarily dismiss the familiar to a pocket dimension. Alternatively, you can dismiss it forever. As a Magic|XPHB action while it is temporarily dismissed, you can cause it to reappear in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you. Whenever the familiar drops to 0 Hit Points|XPHB or disappears into the pocket dimension, it leaves behind in its space anything it was wearing or carrying.You can't have more than one familiar at a time. If you cast this spell while you have a familiar, you instead cause it to adopt a new eligible form.",
