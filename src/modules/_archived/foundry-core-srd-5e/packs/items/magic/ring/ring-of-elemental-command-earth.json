On a failed save, the Elemental has the Charmed|XPHB condition until the start your next turn, and you determine what it does with its move and action on its next turn.\nWhile wearing the ring, you benefit from additional properties corresponding to the ring's linked Elemental Plane: • You know Terran, and you have Resistance|XPHB to Acid damage. Terrain composed of rubble, rocks, or dirt isn't Difficult Terrain|XPHB for you. In addition, you can move through solid earth or rock as if those areas were Difficult Terrain|XPHB without disturbing the matter through which you pass. If you end your turn in solid earth or rock, you are shunted out to the nearest unoccupied space you last occupied.The ring has 5 charges and regains 1d4 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the ring, you can cast a spell from it. A spell cast from the ring has a save DC of 18.
