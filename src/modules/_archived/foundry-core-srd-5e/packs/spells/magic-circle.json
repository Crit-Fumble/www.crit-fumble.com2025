Glowing runes appear wherever the Cylinder [Area of Effect]|XPHB|Cylinder intersects with the floor or other surface.

The circle affects a creature of the chosen type in the following ways: • The creature can't willingly enter the Cylinder [Area of Effect]|XPHB|Cylinder by nonmagical means. If the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to do so, it must first succeed on a Charisma saving throw.\n• The creature has Disadvantage|XPHB on attack rolls against targets within the Cylinder [Area of Effect]|XPHB|Cylinder.\n• Targets within the Cylinder [Area of Effect]|XPHB|Cylinder can't be possessed by or gain the Charmed|XPHB or Frightened|XPHB condition from the creature.\nEach time you cast this spell, you can cause its magic to operate in the reverse direction, preventing a creature of the specified type from leaving the Cylinder [Area of Effect]|XPHB|Cylinder and protecting targets outside it.\n\n<p><strong>At Higher Levels:</strong> The duration increases by 1 hour for each spell slot level above 3.</p>",
