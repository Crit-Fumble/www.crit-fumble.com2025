If you take a Magic|XPHB action to throw the figurine to a point on the ground within 60 feet of yourself, the figurine becomes a living creature specified in the figurine's description below. If the space where the creature would appear is occupied by other creatures or objects, or if there isn't enough space for the creature, the figurine doesn't become a creature. The creature is Friendly [Attitude]|XPHB|Friendly to you and your allies. It understands your languages, obeys your commands, and takes its turn immediately after you on your Initiative|XPHB count. If you issue no commands, the creature defends itself but takes no other actions. The creature exists for a duration specific to each figurine. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its figurine form. It reverts to a figurine early if its creature form drops to 0 Hit Points|XPHB or if you take a Magic|XPHB action while touching the creature to make it revert to figurine form. When the creature becomes a figurine again, its property can't be used again until a certain amount of time has passed, as specified below. This silver statuette of a raven can become a Raven|XMM for up to 12 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 2 days have passed. While in raven form, the figurine grants you the ability to cast Animal Messenger|XPHB on it.",
