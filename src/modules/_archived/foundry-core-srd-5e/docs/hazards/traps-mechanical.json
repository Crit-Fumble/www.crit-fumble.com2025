A hidden pit can be a fun surprise, but too many traps in an adventure can lead players to become overly cautious, which slows down the game. The best traps are fleeting distractions that skilled characters can overcome in a short amount of time or deadly puzzles that require quick thinking and teamwork to overcome."
