While the target is within 60 feet of you, it gains a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws, and it has Resistance|XPHB to all damage. Also, each time it takes damage, you take the same amount of damage. The spell ends if you drop to 0 Hit Points|XPHB or if you and the target become separated by more than 60 feet. It also ends if the spell is cast again on either of the connected creatures.",
