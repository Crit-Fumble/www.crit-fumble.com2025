Each creature in the Sphere [Area of Effect]|XPHB|Sphere must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 5d4 Force damage. A sphere of transparent force then encloses the area for 1 minute. Any creature that failed the save and is completely within the area is trapped inside this sphere. Creatures that succeeded on the save or are partially within the area are pushed away from the center of the sphere until they are no longer inside it. Only breathable air can pass through the sphere's wall. No attack or other effect can pass through. An enclosed creature can take a Utilize|XPHB action to push against the sphere's wall, moving the sphere up to half the creature's Speed|XPHB. The sphere can be picked up, and its magic causes it to weigh only 1 pound, regardless of the weight of creatures inside.",
