As a Magic|XPHB action, you can expend 1 of the cube's charges to cast one of the following spells using the cube. Pressing one side of the cube, you cast Gate|XPHB, opening a portal to the plane of existence keyed to that side.Pressing one side of the cube twice, you cast Plane Shift|XPHB, transporting the targets to the plane of existence keyed to that side.",
