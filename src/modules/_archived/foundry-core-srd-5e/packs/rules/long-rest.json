During a Long Rest, you sleep for at least 6 hours and perform no more than 2 hours of light activity, such as reading, talking, eating, or standing watch. During sleep, you have the Unconscious|XPHB condition. After you finish a Long Rest, you must wait at least 16 hours before starting another one. To start a Long Rest, you must have at least 1 Hit Points|XPHB|Hit Point. When you finish the rest, you gain the following benefits:• You regain all lost Hit Points|XPHB and all spent Hit Point Dice|XPHB. If your Hit Point maximum was reduced, it returns to normal.\n• If any of your ability scores were reduced, they return to normal.\n• If you have the Exhaustion|XPHB condition, its level decreases by 1.\n• Some features are recharged by a Long Rest. If you have such a feature, it recharges in the way specified in its description.\nA Long Rest is stopped by the following interruptions:• Rolling Initiative|XPHB\n• Casting a spell other than a cantrip\n• Taking any damage\n• 1 hour of walking or other physical exertion.\nIf you rested at least 1 hour before the interruption you gain the benefits of a Short Rest|XPHB. You can resume a Long Rest immediately after an interruption. If you do so, the rest requires 1 additional hour per interruption to finish."
