While you are holding it, you can take a Magic|XPHB action and use one of three command words to cause one of the following effects: • The gem sheds Bright Light|XPHB in a 30-foot radius and Dim Light|XPHB for an additional 30 feet. This effect doesn't expend a charge. It lasts until you take a Bonus Action|XPHB to repeat the command word or until you use another function of the gem.\n• You expend 1 charge and cause the gem to fire a brilliant beam of light at one creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have the Blinded|XPHB condition for 1 minute. The creature repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.\n• You expend 5 charges and cause the gem to flare with intense light in a 30-foot Cone [Area of Effect]|XPHB|Cone. Each creature in the Cone [Area of Effect]|XPHB|Cone makes a saving throw as if struck by the beam created with the second command word.\nWhen all of the gem's charges are expended, the gem becomes a nonmagical jewel worth 50 GP.",
