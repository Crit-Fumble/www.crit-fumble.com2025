The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or shape-shift into Beast form for the duration. That form can be any Beast|bestiary|type=beast|miscellaneous=!swarm you choose that has a Challenge Rating|XPHB equal to or less than the target's (or the target's level if it doesn't have a Challenge Rating|XPHB). The target's game statistics are replaced by the stat block of the chosen Beast, but the target retains its alignment, personality, creature type, Hit Points|XPHB, and Hit Point Dice|XPHB. The target gains a number of Temporary Hit Points|XPHB equal to the Hit Points|XPHB of the Beast form. These Temporary Hit Points|XPHB vanish if any remain when the spell ends. The spell ends early on the target if it has no Temporary Hit Points|XPHB left. The target is limited in the actions it can perform by the anatomy of its new form, and it can't speak or cast spells. The target's gear melds into the new form. The creature can't use or otherwise benefit from any of that equipment.",
