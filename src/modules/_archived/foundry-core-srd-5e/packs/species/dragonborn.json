      "value": "Your lineage stems from a dragon progenitor. Choose the kind of dragon from the Draconic Ancestors table. Your choice affects your Breath Weapon and Damage|XPHB Resistance|XPHB traits as well as your appearance.When you take the Attack|XPHB action on your turn, you can replace one of your attacks with an exhalation of magical energy in either a 15-foot Cone [Area of Effect]|XPHB|Cone or a 30-foot Line [Area of Effect]|XPHB|Line that is 5 feet wide (choose the shape each time). Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC 8 plus your Constitution modifier and Proficiency|XPHB|Proficiency Bonus). On a failed save, a creature takes 1d10 damage of the type determined by your Draconic Ancestry trait. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage. This damage increases by 1d10 when you reach character levels 5 (2d10), 11 (3d10), and 17 (4d10). You can use this Breath Weapon a number of times equal to your Proficiency|XPHB|Proficiency Bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest|XPHB.You have Resistance|XPHB to the damage type determined by your Draconic Ancestry trait.You have Darkvision|XPHB with a range of 60 feet.When you reach character level 5, you can channel draconic magic to give yourself temporary flight. As a Bonus Action|XPHB, you sprout spectral wings on your back that last for 10 minutes or until you retract the wings (no action required) or have the Incapacitated|XPHB condition. During that time, you have a Fly Speed|XPHB equal to your Speed|XPHB. Your wings appear to be made of the same energy as your Breath Weapon. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a Long Rest|XPHB.",
