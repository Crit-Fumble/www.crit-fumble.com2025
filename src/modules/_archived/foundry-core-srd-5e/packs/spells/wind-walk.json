While in this cloud form, a target has a Fly Speed|XPHB of 300 feet and can hover; it has Immunity|XPHB to the Prone|XPHB condition; and it has Resistance|XPHB to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage. The only actions a target can take in this form are the Dash|XPHB action or a Magic|XPHB action to begin reverting to its normal form. Reverting takes 1 minute, during which the target has the Stunned|XPHB condition. Until the spell ends, the target can revert to cloud form, which also requires a Magic|XPHB action followed by a 1-minute transformation. If a target is in cloud form and flying when the effect ends, the target descends 60 feet per round for 1 minute until it lands, which it does safely. If it can't land after 1 minute, it falls the remaining distance.",
