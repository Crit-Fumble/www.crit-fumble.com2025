You can use the talisman as a Holy Symbol. You gain a +2 bonus to spell attack rolls while you wear or hold it.The talisman has 6 charges. While wearing or holding the talisman, you can take a Magic|XPHB action to expend 1 charge and target one creature you can see on the ground within 120 feet of yourself. A flaming fissure opens under the target, and the target makes a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw. If the target is a Celestial, it has Disadvantage|XPHB on the save. On a failed save, the target falls into the fissure and is destroyed, leaving no remains. On a successful save, the target isn't cast into the fissure but takes 4d6 Psychic damage from the ordeal. In either case, the fissure then closes, leaving no trace of its existence. When you expend the last charge, the talisman dissolves into foul-smelling slime and is destroyed.\n\n<p><strong>Attunement:</strong> true</p>",
