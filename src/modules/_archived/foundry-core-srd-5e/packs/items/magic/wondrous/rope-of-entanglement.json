While holding one end of the rope, you can take a Magic|XPHB action to command the other end to dart forward and entangle one creature you can see within 20 feet of yourself. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or have the Restrained|XPHB condition. You can release the target by letting go of your end of the rope (causing the rope to coil up in the target's space) or by using a Bonus Action|XPHB to repeat the command (causing the rope to coil up in your hand). A target Restrained|XPHB by the rope can take an action to make its choice of a DC 15 Strength (Athletics|XPHB) or Dexterity (Acrobatics|XPHB) check. On a successful check, the target is no longer Restrained|XPHB by the rope. If you're still holding onto the rope when a target escapes from it, you can take a Reaction|XPHB to command the rope to coil up in your hand; otherwise, the rope coils up in the target's space. The rope has AC 20, HP 20, and Immunity|XPHB to Poison and Psychic damage. It regains 1 Hit Points|XPHB|Hit Point every 5 minutes as long as it has at least 1 Hit Points|XPHB|Hit Point.
