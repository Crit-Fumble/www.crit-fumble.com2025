When you cast this spell, you can designate creatures to be unaffected by it. Any other creature's Speed|XPHB is halved in the Emanation [Area of Effect]|XPHB|Emanation, and whenever the Emanation [Area of Effect]|XPHB|Emanation enters a creature's space and whenever a creature enters the Emanation [Area of Effect]|XPHB|Emanation or ends its turn there, the creature must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d8 Radiant damage (if you are good or neutral) or 3d8 Necrotic damage (if you are evil). On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage. A creature makes this save only once per turn.\n\n<p><strong>At Higher Levels:</strong> The damage increases by 3d8|3-9|1d8 for each spell slot level above 3.</p>",
